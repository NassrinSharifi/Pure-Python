In my view,the experienced and sohpisticated employees are a boon for any company. I think keeping a hardwoking employee in the company offers more benefits than hiring  a new one. First of all, it takes a considerable amount of time for newcommers to get familiar with the work. No matter how educated they are, they need to find their way in the new company.Secondly,training the present employees can save money for the company since they are already familiar with the job details and just need to learn about new technologies and procedures to keep up with the fast-pace competition.Moreover , I think if the company assures that it keeps past employees if they learn new things, those employees will be more eager to work and it will remarkebaly influence the workplace.To sum it up, I think the company policies should be in a way that helps employees feel valued , as kelly mentioned , and provide them enough motivation for working more eficiently.
